You and MENA Network agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of New York, New York. The failure of MENA Network to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOU shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the TOU is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the TOU remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or the TOU must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred."

      "Please report any violations of the TOU, by emailing to: 

       info@searchinmena.com 

       Our failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. 
       You understand and agree that, because damages are often difficult to quantify, if it becomes necessary for MENA Network to pursue legal action to enforce these Terms, you will be liable to pay MENA Network the following amounts as liquidated damages, which you accept as reasonable estimates of MENA Network’s damages for the specified breaches of these Terms: 

       a. If you post a message that (1) impersonates any person or entity; (2) falsely states or otherwise misrepresents your affiliation with a person or entity; or (3) that includes personal or identifying information about another person without that person's explicit consent, you agree to pay MENA Network one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each such message. This provision does not apply to Content that constitutes lawful non-deceptive parody of public figures.
       b. If you aggregate, display, copy, duplicate, reproduce, or otherwise exploit for any purpose any Content (except for your own Content) in violation of these Terms without MENA Network 's express written permission, you agree to pay MENA Network three thousand dollars ($3,000) for each day on which you engage in such conduct.
       c. Otherwise, you agree to pay MENA Network's actual damages, to the extent such actual damages can be reasonably calculated. Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms, MENA Network retains the right to seek the remedy of specific performance of any term contained in these Terms, or a preliminary or permanent injunction against the breach of any such term or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in these Terms, or any combination thereof."
